                    <h1>To find the top car insurance companies:</h1> <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visit your state insurance commissioner’s website to find complaints and other information
                            about companies in your area.</li>
                        <li>Ask your agent or a customer service representative any questions you have to make sure
                            you’re getting all the coverage you need — and nothing you don’t want. </li>
                        <li>Consider smaller insurance companies, too. Small companies offer rates well below large
                            competitors in many locations.</li>
                        <li>If you’ve had tickets, DUIs or other violations, be sure to shop three and five years after
                            the incident, when surcharges can drop significantly.</li>
